# Further Enhancements for Your Project

We are excited to offer you a set of further enhancements that can significantly improve your project's functionality and robustness. These enhancements will be available for purchase under a commercial license. Below are the proposed features:

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Configurable Logging
This enhancement will allow users to specify the logging level via command-line arguments. Users can choose from different logging levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to control the verbosity of logs generated by the application.

### 2. Enhanced Parsing Logic
We aim to make the parsing logic more robust by improving the ability to handle various input formats and structures. This will ensure that your application can correctly parse different types of Nmap and Metasploit output files, providing greater flexibility and reliability.

### 3. Unit Tests for Parser and ReportGenerator
Creating comprehensive unit tests for both `Parser.py` and `ReportGenerator.py` will help ensure that the functionality of these components remains correct and reliable. These tests will be similar to those created for `Main.py`, and will include various scenarios to validate the output against expected results.
